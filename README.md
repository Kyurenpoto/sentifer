# sentifer

**sentifer** is my mono repository.

The purpose of **sentifer** is to remove dependencies on a specific version by placing my repositories as submodules.

Now my side project is developed in this repository. When it is determined that the prototype with minimal functions is completed, it moved out to an independent repository and switched to a submodule with **sentifer**.
